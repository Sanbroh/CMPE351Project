**Abstract**—This project investigates the impact of financial news sentiment on market volatility, and explores the potential to enhance
current low-volatility investment strategies through the integration of news sentiment. Using the FNSPID financial dataset and volatility
measurements to explore three research areas: sentiment trends across periods of high and low volatility, the relationship between
sentiment and abnormal stock price and trading volume, and the integration of a sentiment variable in existing minimum volatility
portfolio strategies. It was found that while sentiment is not a strong standalone predictor, it provides valuable context, particularly
during periods of high uncertainty. While there was minimal correlation between sentiment and sector-specific performance, and little
predictive power for daily volatility, sentiment did prove useful at the portfolio level. It was found that sentiment-enhanced models
performed better inter-day, offering greater adaptability and downside protection during periods of volatility. By incorporating sentiment
analysis, this project demonstrates that sentiment can refine risk management in dynamic market environments.
